# rdscom

A simple and flexible communication library for C++, originally designed for use in Robot Design Studio (RDS) @ Northwestern University.

## Running Examples

There are a few examples in the `examples` directory. To build them, run the following command:

```bash
./build_examples.sh
```

This will create a build directory with all the examples compiled. To run them run the following command:

```bash
./run_examples.sh
```

This will check for the executables in the build directory and ask you which one you want to run.

Alternatively, you can run the examples manually by running the following command:

```bash
./build/<example_name>.exe
```
